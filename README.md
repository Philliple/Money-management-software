# Money-Management-Software [MMS Bankapp]
Just a software that is an ongoing project, but baically it's a software that manages the amount of money you have at one time and the value in physical bills present. So you don't have to be counting it everytime you want to know how much you have in cash.

[This code is in C++ and was made using visual studio as a compiler.]

[If you only want the code file than you should just download the file named Bankapp.sln, but i do recommend just downloading everything since it's so small in disk space that there really is no harm.]

[Disclaimer: This application is still under development so a compiler is needed to run it in console32.There are no finalized stable version produced yet. Thus, there is no support for this application.]
