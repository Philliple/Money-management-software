# Money-management-software
Just a software that is an ongoing project, but baically it's a software that manages the amount of money you have at one time and the value in physical bills present. So you don't have to be counting it everytime you want to know how much you have in cash.

[This code is in C++ and was made using visual studio as a compiler.]

[If you only want the code file than you should just download the file named Bankapp.sln, but i do recommend just downloading everything since it's so small in disk space that there really is no harm.]

UPDATE NOTES: So I recently organized the files so that it would be easier to access for anyone that wanted to check the codes. Hence, the two files one is labeled “unpacked version” which would be the file that houses all of the raw un-build solutions for Visual studios. The second file is named “packed version” which indicates that this will be the file that housed the independent .exe file that will run separately from visual studio as a non-debugging executable.

[Disclaimer: This application is still under development so a compiler is needed to run it in console32.There are no finalized stable version produced yet. Thus, there is no support for this application.]
